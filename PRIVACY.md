# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 13, 2026

## Overview

This extension is designed to add a trading shortcut button on Meteora pages and open Axiom in a popup window.

## Data Collection

The extension does **not** collect, sell, or transmit personal data to its own servers.

## Data Usage

The extension may:

- Read page context on supported Meteora pages to detect pool/token information.
- Store local configuration and cache data in `chrome.storage.local` (for example, UI preferences and temporary pair-cache entries).
- Call third-party public APIs (such as DexScreener and GeckoTerminal) to resolve a likely best-liquidity pair.

## Data Storage

- Data is stored locally in the browser (`chrome.storage.local`).
- No custom backend is used by this extension.

## Third-Party Services

When used, the extension may interact with:

- `app.meteora.ag`
- `axiom.trade`
- `api.dexscreener.com`
- `api.geckoterminal.com`

Their own privacy policies apply to requests made to their services.

## Security

The extension requests only permissions needed for its core functionality (`storage`, `windows`, and limited host permissions).

## Contact

For questions, open an issue in the project repository.
