ADR-001: Meteora DLMM Swap Button Injection

Date: 2026-02-12
Status: Proposed (Prototype implemented)

Context
- Need an extension-injected Swap entrypoint on Meteora DLMM pool pages.
- Need robust token mint extraction on SPA pages and a minimal overlay UI.
- Full swap implementation is undecided.

Options considered
A) Deep-link into Axiom with prefilled tokens.
B) In-page overlay iframe to Axiom pool/token page.
C) In-page custom swap implementation.

Decision
- Primary path: open Axiom in extension popup window via `chrome.windows.create`.
- Fallback path: show explicit "Open Axiom" button in-page if popup creation fails.

Rationale
- Keeps swap execution on Axiom as product requirement.
- Avoids `X-Frame-Options`/CSP frame restrictions that cause `refused to connect`.
- Popup window gives compact minimal-swap UX without iframe risks.
- For token CA inputs, extension resolves the most liquid Solana pair (DexScreener ranking) and opens that pair address on Axiom.

Consequences
- Extension no longer attempts iframe embedding for Axiom.
- Background service worker is required for popup creation.
- Keep extraction logic independent from routing target (Axiom URL builder can change).
